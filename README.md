# DIComponent

This is a POC project to demonstrate how to use DI to swap out components at runtime in Angular. Depending on the value coming out of the FeatureFlagService, a different component will be rendered at run time.

Ideally this would be done without the need for all the magic in the "baseComponent". More research is needed to see if this is possible.



This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
